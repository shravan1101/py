# Set Methods
# There are several in-built methods used for the manipulation of set.They are explained below

# isdisjoint():
# The isdisjoint() method checks if items of given set are present in another set. This method returns False if items are present, else it returns True.

# Example:
# cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
# cities2 = {"Tokyo", "Seoul", "Kabul", "Madrid"}
# print(cities.isdisjoint(cities2))
# Output:
# False

# issuperset():
# The issuperset() method checks if all the items of a particular set are present in the original set. It returns True if all the items are present, else it returns False.

# Example:
# cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
# cities2 = {"Seoul", "Kabul"}
# print(cities.issuperset(cities2))
# cities3 = {"Seoul", "Madrid","Kabul"}
# print(cities.issuperset(cities3))
# Output:
# False
# False

# issubset():

# cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
# cities2 = {"Delhi", "Madrid"}
# print(cities2.issubset(cities))


# add()
# If you want to add a single item to the set use the add() method.

# Example:
# cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
# cities.add("Helsinki")
# print(cities)

# update()
# it is use whrn adding one than more item to a set

# cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
# cities2 = {"Helsinki", "Warsaw", "Seoul"}
# cities.update(cities2) # cities get update by cities 2
# print(cities)


# remove()/discard()

cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
cities.remove("Tokyo")  # it will throw a error when the item is not found
print(cities)

cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
cities.discard("shravan")  # it will throw a error when the item is not found
print(cities)
# pop()
# cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
# item = cities.pop()
# print(cities)
# print(item)


# del

# cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
# del cities # entire set is deleted which mean it is not define
# print(cities)

# clear():
cities = {"Tokyo", "Madrid", "Berlin", "Delhi"}
cities.clear()
print(cities)
